# Deep-Learning-Course
Learning and Implementing Deep Learning Algorithms based on Real World Case studies. 

As a part of my learning experience, I would like to share my Deep Learning skills using Python. The repository will contain implementations of tackling some real world problems for classification, prediction modelling and recommender systems.

The implementations are based on the coursework titled Deep Learning A-Z: Hands on Artificial Neural Networks by  Kirill Eremenko, Hadelin de Ponteves, SuperDataScience Team.
